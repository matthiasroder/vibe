Using the architecture defined in **architecture.md**, write a granular step-by-step plan to build the MVP. Each task should:

- Be incredibly small and testable  
- Have a clear start and end  
- Focus on one concern  

Iâ€™ll be passing this off to an engineering LLM that will be told to complete one task at a time, allowing me to test in between.  
Do **not** use icons or emoticons.  
Save the output to a file named **tasks.md**.
