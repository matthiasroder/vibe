# AGENTS.md - Coding Agent Guidelines

## Engineering Principles
- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits
- Focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don't break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. bash/python etc.), tell me clearly
