# AGENTS.md - Coding Agent Guidelines

## Build/Test Commands
- No package.json found - this is a template/documentation repository
- No specific build or test commands available
- Check for project-specific build files when implementing actual projects

## Engineering Principles
- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits
- Focus on just the task you're on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don't break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. bash/python etc.), tell me clearly

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused on single concerns
- Prefer explicit over implicit code
- No comments unless absolutely necessary for complex logic
- Test each small change before moving to the next task

## Workflow
- Read architecture.md and tasks.md before starting
- Complete one task at a time from tasks.md
- Stop after each task for testing/validation
- Commit only when explicitly requested
